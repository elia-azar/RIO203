List of TODOs

If you are using Windows:
    Install VirtualBox
    Install Ubuntu 18.04 image
    Use Ubuntu for the project
    Download git
    For those working on the dashboard, dowload docker


Overall:
    Create Smart city with smart grid
    Create 3 plans for energy consumption per household
    Create 6 Households
    Each household will consist of approx. 4-6 nodes (washing machine, lights, temperature, fridge, ...)
    Create public services like smart trash/recycle bins
    Each customer is affiliated to a household and can control his nodes, but not the other ones


Fit-IOT group:
    Do the tutorials sent by the professor
    Create CoAP client for Actuation purposes (Force a node to change value)
    Create CoAP client for Monitoring purposes (Send request for energy consumption of a node)
    Create CoAP client for Sensing purposes (Send request to collect data of a specific sensor)

RPi group:
    Read the manual of RPi
    Read the manual of Sunfounder and decide on what sensors should be used
    Create a server on RPi to send data to client and receive orders from client
    Create a client that sends request to RPi regarding actuation, monitoring and sensing

Dashboard:
    Learn how to use https://thingsboard.io/ (Follow tutorials on https://thingsboard.io/docs/guides/)
    See if we can include nodes from Fit-IOT and RPi into the dashboard and manipulate them

Database:
    Learn how to use Postgres with a tutorial (Store data in tables, send request to collect data ...)


AWS (not mandatory, depends on our progress):
    Implement the dashboard on AWS
