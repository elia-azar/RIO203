Erbium (Er) REST Engine for iotlab-m3
=====================================

This example is adapted from `contiki/examples/er-rest-example`. See its readme file for more explanations.

We tried here to bring the less diff possible with the original example, adding at the same time the more features from the iotlab-m3 platform.

## Default Resources
  - actuators/toggle
  - sensors/accel
  - sensors/gyros
  - sensors/light
  - sensors/magne
  - sensors/pressure
  - test/hello
  - test/push

## Observable Resources
  - The PERIODIC feature is implemented by the test/push resource.  
  - The EVENT feature is implemented by the test/serial resources (disabled by default).
